Description: Provides a consistent interface to the Keras Deep Learning Library
  directly from within R. Keras provides specifications for describing dense
  neural networks, convolution neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks
  (RNN) running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. Type conversions between
  Python and R are automatically handled correctly, even when the default
  choices would otherwise lead to errors. Includes complete R documentation
  and many working examples.
